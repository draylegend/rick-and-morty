# Rick And Morty

"Rick and Morty Search" is an application that provides a simple interface to search through characters, episodes, locations and more from the popular Adult Swim animated series Rick and Morty.

Users can enter a search term in the main search bar to find matches across all data available in the Rick and Morty API. Results are displayed in an easy to browse grid view with character/episode/location names, images and brief descriptions.

Tapping or clicking on a result opens up a detailed screen with more information pulled directly from the API, such as a character's backstory, list of appearances in episodes or statistics about a location. Key information is displayed right away with an option to see the full description.

Advanced search filters allow drilling down results by type (characters, episodes etc), gender, species and other attributes. A favorites feature lets users save characters, episodes or locations to quickly find them later without searching again.

The app provides a simple, intuitive interface for fans of the show to discover and learn more about their favorite characters, plot lines and other elements from Rick and Morty universe by tapping into the rich data available in the public Rick and Morty API.

## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve angular-client`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.
